# Automated Image Scanning with AWS CodePipeline & ECR

The purpose of this project is to scan docker images for vulnerabilities from a CI/CD pipeline. I use AWS CodePipeline to scan Docker images stored in AWS ECR. You can find the implementation details from this [article](https://medium.com/@duleendra/eventbridge-pipes-using-terraform-ae3abe6266cc).
